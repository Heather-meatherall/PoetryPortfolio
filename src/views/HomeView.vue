      </h3>
      Heather got her start writing poems for school, family and friends. in 2021 she had 
      the incredible oppertunity to be apart of <a href=https://www.kristenoyer.com/poesie-collaboration>The Poesie Collaboration</a>
      ,where a painting was made based on her poem <a href=https://www.kristenoyer.com/poesie-poems>I Will Not Tell You</a>. From there she
      discovered the wonderful world of indie presses. <a href="https://www.rosalindsciencepress.com/read">Magazines</a> that mix art and science,
      <a href="https://www.icaruswritingcollective.com">volumes</a> stuffed full of works inspired by myths and legends, and <a href="https://www.theweesparrowpoetrypress.com/">anthologies</a> that give back in more ways
      then one, there's no limit to what shell write or where she'll submit to.She's had her work featured
      in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3ADreams%2B%2BIn%2BHiding&s=relevancerank&text=Dreams++In+Hiding">Dreams In Hiding Anthologies</a>,

      <h3>Poetical Science

The box is on a brown desk, and there is a mini TARDIS, a ceramic duck, and mug with a ceramic duck to the left hand side. A blanket made up of sea green and pink flower granny squares is drapped over a chair. Words at the bottom of the page read 'Programers have always been poets, we just aren't in the habit of thinking overselves that way'">

      </h3>
      Heather studies computer science at Ontario Tech University. She's taken a number of poetry classes
      over the course of her time there, none of which are technically poetry classes. Physics, computer science, 
      and astronomy find their way into her poems in some shape or form,
      and she has a habit of paraphrsing and romantising the very concepts she learned in class. 
      She's even coded her own poetry portfoilo website (yes, the very same one you're on now!)

In front of the bag there is a green crochet hook, a white and gold d20, and a clay pot painted to look like a mushroom house with a crocht flower growing out of it. Words at the bottom of the page read 'In the face of the dull and the dark and the gray I give you spontaneous adventuers and silly little sidequests' ">

      </h3>
       A self proclaimed Jack of All Trades, Heather's habit of asking "Well How Hard Could It Be?" and not waiting
    to hear the answer often leads her setting off on side quests and falling down weird and wonderful
    rabbit holes. She can often be found crocheting, playing music, going on public transit adventures
    or throwing her dnd charatcers into new and exciting situations (though if you ask them they probably
    wouldn't describe it that way)
